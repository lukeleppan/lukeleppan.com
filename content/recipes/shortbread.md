## Tips

- You can replace the butter with Stork Baking Margarine to cut costs in half.
- Nan used to double the measurements to fit larger trays.
- Depending on your oven, 1 hour may not be enough. So you may have to leave it in for longer.
- Optionally, if you want it to be crispy, you can cut the pieces and put the tray back into the oven at a lower temperature (i.e. 100°C) for 15 to 20 minutes.
